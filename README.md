- 👋 Hi, I’m @leechristinee or Christine, who graduates with an Information Science Major and General Business & Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy Minor in 2026. Within information science, I am particularly interested in the Data Science field.
- 👀 I’m interested in the world of business, aside from tech, and would love to be my own boss and a business owner in the future. Understanding people and the ways of the world also interest me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few different sports, love to cook, and am constantly figuring out how to develop myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all random personal ideas (within reason of course) and what is beyond our careers.
- 📫 Personal email: lee28.christine@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Milk before cereal, always.
